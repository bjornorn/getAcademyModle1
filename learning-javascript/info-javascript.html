          What is JavaScript? JavaScript was initially created to “make web
          pages alive”. The programs in this language are called scripts. They
          can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the
          page loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They
          don’t need special preparation or compilation to run. In this aspect,
          JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
        </p>

        <p>
          Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not
          provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially
          created for browsers which do not require it.
